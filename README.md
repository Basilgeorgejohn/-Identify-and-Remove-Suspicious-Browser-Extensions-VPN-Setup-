# Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, hiding your real IP address and protecting data from hackers or tracking. It improves privacy, secures public Wi-Fi use, and helps bypass geo-restrictions, though it may reduce speed and is not fully anonymous.

## üõ† Tools Used
- **ProtonVPN (Free Tier)** / **Windscribe Free**
- Web Browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
- [WhatIsMyIPAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com)

---

## üîê VPN Setup Steps
1. Signed up for a free VPN service (ProtonVPN/Windscribe).  
2. Downloaded and installed the VPN client.  
3. Connected to a VPN server (nearest location).  
4. Verified IP address change using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  
5. Tested encrypted browsing by visiting websites.  
6. Disconnected VPN and compared browsing speed & IP.

after i use this to check https://whatismyipaddress.com

change my ip i conform and i can access resticketeed website ans secure my data

## üåç IP Verification using WhatIsMyIPAddress

To confirm that ProtonVPN was working correctly, I used [WhatIsMyIPAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com) before and after connecting to the VPN.

 ## üìù Summary

In this task, I explored how VPNs help in protecting online privacy and securing communication.  
I successfully installed and used ProtonVPN on Kali Linux, verified the change in IP address using [WhatIsMyIPAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com), and confirmed that my internet traffic was encrypted and routed through the VPN server.  

Additionally, I reviewed my browser extensions, identified suspicious ones, and removed them to improve security.  
Through this exercise, I learned about the benefits of VPNs (encryption, privacy, bypassing geo-restrictions) as well as their limitations (slower speeds, limited anonymity, and server restrictions in free plans).  

Overall, this task gave me **hands-on experience with VPN setup, IP verification, and browser extension security**, which are essential skills in cybersecurity.
