# Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, hiding your real IP address and protecting data from hackers or tracking. It improves privacy, secures public Wi-Fi use, and helps bypass geo-restrictions, though it may reduce speed and is not fully anonymous.
